title: Who I am.

I am an Assistant Professor (Universitair Docent) at **Leiden University** in the **[Centre for Linguistics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/leiden-university-centre-for-linguistics)** and the **[Institute for Area Studies](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/institute-for-area-studies)**.

Previously, I was a [JSPS](http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) postdoctoral fellow in the **[Institute of Cultural and Linguistic Studies](http://www.icl.keio.ac.jp/)** at **Keio University** in Tokyo, during which I was also a visiting scholar at **[Institut Jean-Nicod](http://www.institutnicod.org/)** in Paris.

In 2015, I completed my PhD study at **[MIT Linguistics](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/)**, with the PhD dissertation *[Interpreting questions under attitudes](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/99318)*. The dissertation addresses a family of puzzles for the compositional semantics of the question-embedding phenomena, posed by variability in forms and interpretations of clauses embedded under attitude predicates, such as *know*, *predict*, *surprise* and *wonder*.

I also have the following external appointments in academic journals and conferences:
- an editorial board member of *[Semantics & Pragmatics](http://semprag.org/)*
- a review board member of *[Snippets](http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/)*
- a steering committee member of [Logic and Engineering in Natural Language Semantics](http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~bekki/lenls/).

# What I do.

I am a researcher of **formal semantics and pragmatics**. This means that I study the systematic patterns in which people draw various kinds of inferences from conversations in natural language, and try to understand systems governing such patterns by formalizing them using theoretical tools made available by **linguistics**, **logic** and **cognitive science**.

<!-- I also specialise in **Japanese linguistics**. I investigate various aspects of the grammatical structure of the languages/dialects in Japan, with an aim to uncover the nature of the similarity and differences that the Japanese languages have with other languages in the world. -->

**Teaching** is an essential part of my academic life. See the [Teaching page](wuegaki.github.io/teaching) for my teaching philosophy and information on classes I have taught.
