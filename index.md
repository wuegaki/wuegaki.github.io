I am a Lecturer (~ North American Assistant Professor) in Semantics at **University of Edinburgh** in the **[Department of Linguistics and English Language](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language)** within the **[School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls)**. I also serve as the leader of **the NWO international collaboration project** **[''Searching for semantic universals in the modal domain''](wuegaki.github.io/modal-universals/)**. 

I completed my PhD at **[MIT Linguistics](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/)** in 2015, and was previously at Leiden University. 

I also have the following external appointments in academic journals and conferences:
- an editorial board member of *[Semantics & Pragmatics](http://semprag.org/)*
- a review board member of *[Snippets](http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/)*
- a steering committee member of [Logic and Engineering in Natural Language Semantics (LENLS)](http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~bekki/lenls/).

# What I do.

I am a researcher of **formal semantics and pragmatics**. That is, I study how humans draw various inferences from conversations in natural language, and I try to understand systems governing such human behaviors using theoretical tools made available by **linguistics**, **logic** and **cognitive science**.

Specifically, I am interested in the **relationship between word meanings and grammatical rules**. My PhD dissertation *[Interpreting questions under attitudes](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/99318)* addresses a family of puzzles concerning how the meanings of the so-called propositional attitude verbs (such as *believe*, *know*, *surprise* and *wonder*) are related to the types of complement clauses they can combine with (for example, whether the verb can combine with a question or not). 

More recently, I am interested in the distinction between **'logical' words** (such as *every* and *or*) and **'non-logical' words** (such as *walk* and *bird*). Is there a fundamental distinction between how these two kinds of word meanings are represented in our mind? I try to address this question by investigating the manifestation of this distinction in **syntax-semantics interface** (i.e., the relationship between meaning and grammar) and [**cross-linguistic universals in word meanings**](wuegaki.github.io/modal-universals/) (i.e., what kind of common properties hold for word meanings across languages). 

<!-- I also specialise in **Japanese linguistics**. I investigate various aspects of the grammatical structure of the languages/dialects in Japan, with an aim to uncover the nature of the similarity and differences that the Japanese languages have with other languages in the world. -->

**Teaching** is an essential part of my academic life. See the [Teaching page](wuegaki.github.io/teaching) for my teaching philosophy and information on classes I have taught.
