### Teaching philosophy

Teaching is an essential part of my academic life. Through teaching and interacting with students, I broadened my perspective on fundamental issues in linguistics, and deepened my understanding of the theoretical approaches to such issues. My teaching philosophy consists of three principles:

1. make explicit statements about long-term goals and short-term goals that a student has to achieve;
2. facilitate students’ interest through tangible but non-trivial puzzles;
3. balance empirical and theoretical aspects in teaching specific linguistic analyses.
