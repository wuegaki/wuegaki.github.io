### Teaching philosophy

Teaching and supervision are an essential part of my academic life. Through
teaching and interacting with students, I broadened my perspectives on basic
issues in linguistics, and deepened my understanding of theoretical approaches
to those issues. My teaching philosophy consists of three principles:

1. make clear statements about long-term goals and short-term goals that a student has to achieve;
2. facilitate studentsâ€™ interest through tangible but non-trivial puzzles;
3. balance empirical and theoretical aspects in teaching specific linguistic analyses.

I particularly enjoy teaching introductory linguistics courses at the
undergraduate level, as it is where I first encountered the excitement of
linguistics as a student.
