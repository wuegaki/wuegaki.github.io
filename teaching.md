### Teaching philosophy

Teaching and supervision are an essential part of my academic
life, as they offer me opportunities to make a positive impact on students'
lives using my academic expertise. Through teaching and interacting with
students, I broadened my perspectives on basic issues in linguistics, and
deepened my understanding of theoretical approaches to those issues. My
teaching philosophy consists of three principles:

1. make clear statements about long-term goals and short-term goals that a student has to achieve;
2. facilitate students’ interest through tangible but non-trivial puzzles;
3. balance empirical and theoretical aspects in teaching specific linguistic analyses.

I particularly enjoy teaching introductory linguistics courses at the
undergraduate level, as it is where I first encountered the excitement of
linguistics as a student.
