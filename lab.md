Edinburgh Meaning Science Lab combines theories and methodologies from
cross-linguistic formal semantics and evolutionary linguistics to investigate
questions such as: 'How are meanings expressed in natural language?', 'Are there
universal patterns in the way meanings are encoded in different languages?'; 
'What are the principles that underlie such universal patterns (if there are any)?'; 'How are language-internal and language-external factors interact in such 
principles?'.


Currently, the lab is running the following two research projects: 

- AHRC/DFG project: [MECORE: A cross-linguistic investigation of meaning-driven combinatorial restrictions in clausal embedding](https://wuegaki.ppls.ed.ac.uk/mecore/) (2021-2024)
- UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship: [LiSU: Logic in Semantic Universals](http://www.wataruuegaki.com/flf/) (2022-2025)

### Talk series

Jointly with Brian Rabern (Edinburgh Philosophy), we organise a talk series by

the talk series.
