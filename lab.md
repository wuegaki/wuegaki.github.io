Edinburgh Meaning Science Lab combines theories and methodologies from
cross-linguistic formal semantics and evolutionary linguistics to investigate
questions such as: 'How are meanings expressed in natural language?', 'Are there
universal patterns in the way meanings are encoded in different languages?',
'If there are such universal patterns, what are the principles that underlie
them?'.

Currently, the lab is running the following two research projects: 

- AHRC/DFG project: [MECORE: A cross-linguistic investigation of meaning-driven combinatorial restrictions in clausal embedding](https://wuegaki.ppls.ed.ac.uk/mecore/) (2021-2024)
- UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship: [Logic in Semantic Universals](http://www.wataruuegaki.com/flf/) (2022-2025)
