Edinburgh Meaning Science Lab combines theories and methodologies from
cross-linguistic formal semantics and evolutionary linguistics to investigate
core mechanisms by which (various forms of) meanings are conveyed via natural
language interactions.

Currently, the lab is running the following two research projects: 

- AHRC/DFG project: [MECORE: A cross-linguistic investigation of meaning-driven combinatorial restrictions in clausal embedding](https://wuegaki.ppls.ed.ac.uk/mecore/) (2021-2024)
- UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship: [Logic in Semantic Universals](http://www.wataruuegaki.com/flf/) (2022-2025)
