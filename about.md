### Who I am.

I am an Assistant Professor (Universitair Docent) at [Leiden University Centre for Linguistics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/leiden-university-centre-for-linguistics).

Previously, I was a [JSPS](http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) postdoctoral fellow in the Institute of Cultural and Linguistic Studies at Keio University, during which I was also a visiting scholar at Institut Jean-Nicod in Paris.

In 2015, I completed my PhD study at MIT Linguistics, with the PhD dissertation Interpreting questions under attitudes (pdf on lingbuzz; pdf on the local server). The dissertation addresses a family of puzzles for the compositional semantics of question-embedding sentences, posed by variability in forms and interpretations of clauses embedded under attitude predicates, such as know, predict, surprise and wonder.

I also have the following external appointments in academic journals and conferences:
- an editorial board member of Semantics & Pragmatics
- a review board member of Snippets
- a steering committee member of Logic and Engineering in Natural Language Semantics.

My profiles can also be found on the following sites:
- Profile in the Leiden University website
- Google scholar profile

### What I do.

I am a researcher of formal semantics and pragmatics. That is, I study the systematic patterns in which people draw various kinds of inferences from conversations in natural language, and try to understand systems governing such patterns by formalizing them using theoretical tools made available by linguistics, logic and cognitive science.

I am also interested in Japanese linguistics. I investigate various aspects of the grammatical structure of the languages/dialects in Japan, with an aim to uncover the nature of the similarity and differences that the Japanese languages have with other languages in the world.

Teaching is an essential part of my academic life. See the Teaching page for my teaching philosophy and information on classes I have taught.
